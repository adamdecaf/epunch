## Basic Idea

You walk into a merchant and open the app, we read your geo location and pull up the closest merchants
that you have cards for, or that support having cards. You select it and click to be punched. The client's
phone then shows a short code on the screen that the merchant types in which then the client is notified
that the punch has been accepted and returns back to a screen for that card.
